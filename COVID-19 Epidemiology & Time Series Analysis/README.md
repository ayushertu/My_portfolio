# COVID-19 Epidemiology Dashboard

An end-to-end data analysis project exploring global COVID-19 trends across 235 countries (2020), combining Python-based exploratory analysis with an interactive Power BI dashboard.

---

## Project Overview

This project analyses the spread, mortality, and vaccination patterns of COVID-19 using a dataset of over 85,000 records. It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), trend visualisation, and country-level comparisons — culminating in a Power BI dashboard built for public health storytelling.

## Key Analysis Steps

**1. Data Cleaning**
- Standardised column names and parsed date formats
- Handled missing values in `new_cases`, `new_deaths`, and `vaccinated` columns
- Applied forward-fill for vaccination data; filled case/death nulls with 0

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Daily and cumulative trends for cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Country-level comparison of average daily cases and deaths
- Scatter plot exploring the relationship between vaccination rates and total infections

**3. Power BI Dashboard**
- Interactive visuals for global COVID-19 trends
- Country-level filters and time-series breakdowns
- Designed for public health reporting and communication
